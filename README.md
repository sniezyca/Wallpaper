# Wallpaper
App dowloads bing's image of the day and sets it as desktop wallpaper.

Works on Windows 10 (tested), should also work on Windows 8 and 7(not tested).

Image is downloaded and stored in folder created in  C:\Users\username\My Pictures\Tapety Bing.

App adds itself to autostart - 360 Total Seciurity sees it as threat, but user can allow to add it.
